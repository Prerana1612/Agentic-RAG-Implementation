**AGENTIC RAG IMPLEMENTATION WITH OPEN-SOURCE AND GEMINI 1.5 FLASH/PRO LLM**


__Overview__

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that combines an open-source Large Language Model (LLM) with a vector-based document retrieval system. The system ingests documents, processes them into embeddings, stores them in a vector database, and retrieves the most relevant documents based on a query. The model then generates contextually relevant responses based on the retrieved documents.

The agent is designed to demonstrate agentic behavior by reasoning about when to retrieve documents and when to rely on existing context. It also performs chain-of-thought reasoning, breaking down complex queries into smaller steps and fetching relevant documents at appropriate times.


__Requirements__

Dependencies:

__numpy:__ Used for handling numerical operations and data manipulation, especially for processing and storing embeddings.

__pandas:__ Used for data handling, specifically to load and manage documents in a structured format.

__langchain:__ Facilitates chain-of-thought reasoning and integrates various tools for natural language processing tasks.

__openai:__ Used for interacting with OpenAI models, which helps generate responses based on context from the retrieved documents.

__transformers:__ Provides pre-trained models for natural language processing tasks like document retrieval and text generation.

__pgvector:__ Allows storing vector embeddings in a PostgreSQL database for efficient retrieval and querying.

__sentence-transformers:__ Utilized for encoding text into embeddings that represent the semantic meaning of documents and queries.

__faiss:__ Provides fast similarity search and clustering of embeddings, enabling efficient document retrieval.

__pytest:__ Used for writing tests to ensure that the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) agent behaves as expected.

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Required Environment:
__Gemini 1.5 Flash/Pro:__ Make sure you have the Gemini 1.5 Flash/Pro environment set up as it will be used to run the model for generating responses.

__Setup and Configuration__

__1. Install Dependencies__
Create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies:

python -m venv rag_env   #creating virtual environment

rag_env\Scripts\activate #activating virtual environment

pip install -r requirements.txt  #installing dependencies 

__2. Set Up Gemini 1.5 Flash/Pro__
Ensure that Gemini 1.5 Flash/Pro is properly set up on your machine. This will be used to generate contextually relevant responses in the RAG pipeline. Follow the official Gemini 1.5 setup instructions to configure the environment.

__3. Data__
The data folder contains the following text documents:

doc1.txt: A sample document for ingestion.

doc2.txt: Another sample document for ingestion.
These documents are used to build the knowledge base, which the agent queries for relevant information.

Make sure that the data folder is correctly placed in your project directory and contains the required .txt documents for the ingestion pipeline to work.

__4. Document Ingestion__
The document_ingestion.py script is responsible for loading, preprocessing, and embedding the documents. The documents are stored in the data directory. The documents are processed into embeddings using a pre-trained model (SentenceTransformer).

__5. Vector Storage__
The vector_storage.py script stores the embeddings in a FAISS index. This allows for efficient document retrieval based on similarity search. The FAISS index and documents are saved in the project directory (faiss_index.index and documents.txt).

__6. Running the RAG Pipeline__
The rag_agent.py script is responsible for retrieving documents based on a query and generating responses. The agent uses the FAISS index to retrieve relevant documents and a pre-trained language model (e.g., GPT-Neo) to generate context-aware answers.

__7. Testing the Agent__
The test_rag.py script contains tests for the RAG agent. It tests whether the agent correctly generates responses for sample queries.

Run the tests using pytest:

pytest src/test_rag.py


__Usage__

__Running the Document Ingestion__
To load, preprocess, and embed the documents, run the following:

python src/document_ingestion.py

This will process the documents in the data/ folder and output the number of documents processed.

__Storing Embeddings in FAISS__
To store the embeddings in FAISS, run:

python src/vector_storage.py

This will save the embeddings in the faiss_index.index file and the documents in the documents.txt file.

__Running the RAG Agent__
To retrieve documents and generate a response based on a query, run:

python src/rag_agent.py

The script will prompt the model to answer a query based on the most relevant documents retrieved from the FAISS index.

__Chain-of-Thought Reasoning__
To demonstrate chain-of-thought reasoning, run:

python src/reasoning_agent.py

This will generate a response for a given query using the reasoning mechanism.

__Generating Responses with Chain of Thought__
The chain_of_thought.py script handles document retrieval and response generation. To run it, use:

python src/chain_of_thought.py

Testing the Agent
Run the tests to ensure everything works as expected:

pytest src/test_rag.py


__Example Queries and Responses__

__Query 1: "What is deep learning?"__

Retrieved Documents:
"Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence."

"Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks."

Generated Response: "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks to learn from data and make predictions."

__Query 2: "Explain the concept of neural networks"__

Retrieved Documents:
"Neural networks are a series of algorithms that attempt to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates."

Generated Response: "Neural networks are algorithms that simulate the way the human brain processes information to solve complex problems like pattern recognition."


__Design Overview__

The architecture of the system is designed to leverage the power of large language models for answering queries based on relevant document retrieval. Here's a breakdown of the components:

__Document Ingestion:__ The document_ingestion.py script loads and preprocesses documents into embeddings.
Vector Storage: Embeddings are stored in FAISS for efficient retrieval.

__RAG Agent:__ The agent retrieves documents and generates answers using a pre-trained LLM.

__Chain-of-Thought:__ This reasoning mechanism allows the agent to break down complex queries into smaller, manageable steps.
Testing: Simple queries are used to validate the system's performance.
